<p style="font-family: 'Fira Code', monospace;"> Greatly into Information security and ML.</p>

I am renewing my GitHub so you're gonna see a lot of my content (code, notes,...) starting to get published!

My current status:

- 🔎 I’m currently learning pentesting.
- 🤖 In the future I’m looking to collaborate on my ML webpage, which is currently on hold.
- 📢 I am active in THM.
