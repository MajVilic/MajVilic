Hello my name Maj and I am security engineer.

You are gonna see a lot of my content (code, notes,...) starting to get published!

My current status:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my OSCP
- 🌱 I’m currently learning pentesting.
- 👯 In the future I’m looking to collaborate on my new ML webpage, which is currently on hold.

I am active in THM:
